Problem
You have created a programming language and now you have decided to add hashmap support to it. It was found that in common programming languages, it is impossible to add a number to all hashmap keys/values. So, you have decided to implement your own hashmap in your new language with following operations.

insert x y - insert and object with key x and value y
get x - return the value of an object with key x
addToKey x - add x to all keys in map
addToValue y - add y to all values in map
Your task is to implement this hashmap, apply the given queries, and to find the sum of all the results for get operations.


Example 1
For queryType = ["insert", "insert", "addToValue", "addToKey", "get"] and query = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [2], [1], [3]], the output should be hashMap(queryType, query) = 5.
The hashmap looks like this after each query:
1 query: {1: 2}
2 query: {1: 2, 2: 3}
3 query: {1: 4, 2: 5}
4 query: {2: 4, 3: 5}
5 query: answer is 5
The result of the last get query for 3 is 5 in the resulting hashmap.

Example 2
For queryType = ["insert", "addToValue", "get", "insert", "addToKey", "addToValue", "get"] and query = [[1, 2], [2], [1], [2, 3], [1], [-1], [3]], the output should be hashMap(queryType, query) = 6.
The hashmap looks like this after each query:
1 query: {1: 2}
2 query: {1: 4}
3 query: answer is 4
4 query: {1: 4, 2: 3}
5 query: {2: 4, 3: 3}
6 query: {2: 3, 3: 2}
7 query: answer is 2

The sum of the results for all the get queries is equal to 4 + 2 = 6
